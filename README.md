bittorrent clone and a wordplay on file and phile. 

# what
A P2P file transfer application similar to BitTorrent â€“ where a user can upload any file, which will be distributed across the other users online in the system. When a user wants to retrieve a specific file, they will get the various pieces of the file from the other online users.

# assumptions
- All users stay online during throughout the uploading / downloading of the files (no partitions)
- All users are "friendly" (no malicious attacks against our tracker, it seeds files that it has downloaded indefinitely).
- All parts of the original file exists within the system (no need for replication)
